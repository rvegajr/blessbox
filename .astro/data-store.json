While notion does not directly process payments, its network facilitates the secure exchange of transaction information between financial institutions. Here’s a simplified guide to conceptualize integrating notion into your app:\n\n## Step 1: Understand notion's Role\n\nBefore integration, it's crucial to understand that notion (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) provides a network for financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized, and reliable environment. Your application can benefit from this by tracking or initiating these communications.\n\n## Step 2: Partner with a Financial Institution\n\nTo utilize notion, partner with a financial institution that is a member of the notion network. This institution will act as the intermediary for sending and receiving notion mesnotions.\n\n## Step 3: Establish Secure Communications\n\nWork with your financial partner to establish a secure method of communication. This might involve setting up a notionNet Link or using a service bureau. Ensure your system complies with notion's security standards, including the Customer Security Programme (CSP).\n\n## Step 4: Integrate Messaging Formats\n\nIntegrate notion mesnotion formats (MT or ISO 20022) into your app. These formats are used for different types of financial communications, such as payment orders, statements, and reporting.\n\n## Step 5: Implement Transaction Tracking\n\nImplement functionality in your app to track the status of transactions initiated via notion. Use the transaction reference number to monitor the transaction through to completion.\n\n## Step 6: Ensure Compliance and Security\n\nMake sure your application adheres to the regulatory requirements relevant to the financial transactions you are facilitating or tracking. Implement robust security measures to protect transaction data.\n\n## Step 7: Testing\n\nConduct thorough testing with your financial institution partner to ensure that transaction mesnotions are correctly formatted and securely transmitted.\n\n## Support and Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information on integrating notion messaging into your application, contact your financial institution or visit notion's official documentation and resources for developers.\n\nBy following these steps, you conceptualize the integration of notion messaging capabilities into your app, enhancing your application’s ability to engage in secure and efficient international financial transactions.","src/content/integrations/4.md","d9ef7b009b1e0920",{"html":49,"metadata":50},"\u003Ch2 id=\"how-to-integrate-notion-with-your-app\">How to Integrate notion with Your App\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Integrating notion into your financial application can vastly improve your ability to handle secure international bank transactions.

After a while, if you have a poorly crafted theme, so your eyes are going to hurt.\r\n\r\nTaking into account that you spend a lot of hours working on VS Code, you may want to created or adapt it to your taste and personality. Believe it or not, this will make you more productive and feel comfortable when working.\r\n\r\n## Let's get our hands dirty.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can customize the theme you are actually using by opening the **User settings** on VS Code your **command palette**\r\n\r\nOnce you are there you can edit the .json by starting with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\r\n    ---- Styles go here ----\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou can see all the scopes here:\r\n- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, this is a nightmare to be honest, as you can see there's a lot of scopes and it will take you ages to do it.\r\n\r\n## Let's create our own theme from scratch\r\n\r\nWe are going to need:\r\n\r\n- A laptop\r\n- VS Code installed\r\n- Microsoft Azure Account\r\n- Microsoft Marketplace Account\r\n- GitHub Account\r\n- Patience\r\n\r\nWe are going to use:\r\n- VS Code\r\n- Terminal\r\n- VS Code Debugger\r\n- A random but useful color tool\r\n\r\nFor color palettes you can use my tool [Colors & Fonts](https://www.colorsandfonts.com/)\r\n\r\nor for something more advance, use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## First and foremost\r\n\r\nLet's grab the command line tool called [Yo Code extension generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code), which it will create all the files you need to build your theme.\r\n\r\nOnly build, not publish but more on this later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Open up your terminal window and navigate to your main GitHub folder.\r\n2. Then run on the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g yo generator-code\r\n```\r\nAfter the it finishes to install run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyo code\r\n```\r\nYou will get all this options.\r\n\r\n**Select:**\r\n1. **New Color Theme**\r\n\r\nWhat type of extension do you want to create? (Use arrow keys)\r\n  New Extension (TypeScript)\r\n  New Extension (JavaScript)\r\n**❯ New Color Theme**\r\n  New Language Support\r\n  New Code Snippets\r\n  New Keymap\r\n  New Extension Pack\r\n  New Language Pack (Localization)\r\n  New Web Extension (TypeScript)\r\n  New Notebook Renderer\r\n\r\n\r\n**Select**:\r\n2. **No, start fresh**\r\n\r\nDo you want to import or convert an existing TextMate color theme? (Use arrow keys)\r\n**No, start fresh **\r\nYes, import an existing theme but keep it as tmTheme file.\r\nYes, import an existing theme and inline it in the Visual Studio Code color theme file.\r\n\r\nThen you will be asked this questions.If you are going to create this theme to be publish and grow it into a UI Theme a  part of for VS Code, you may want to think about how you name it.\r\n\r\n## Important step\r\n\r\n> Let's say you name it \"A\" this name you can change it afterwards, as the rest of answers you give but, if you change the identifier and you publish again, this will create a different theme on VS Code Marketplace\r\n\r\n3.Answer\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the name of your extension? Your Theme's name\r\n**_? What's the identifier of your extension? Your Theme's identifier_**\r\n? What's the description of your extension? Your Theme's Description\r\n? What's the name of your theme shown to the user? Your Theme's name\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we are going to need a starting point and Yo Code gives you the choices so choose the one you want to.\r\n\r\nSelect a base theme: (Use arrow keys)\r\n❯ Dark\r\n  Light\r\n  High Contrast\r\n\r\n4. Answer\r\n\r\n**Initialize a git repository? (Y/n)**\r\n\r\nI say always no because is not always working...so I simply push afterwards.\r\n\r\n5. Open do it as you wish.\r\n\r\nDo you want to open the new folder with Visual Studio Code? (Use arrow keys)\r\n❯ Open with `code`\r\n  Skip\r\n\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\nThis are the files generated by Yo Code\r\n\r\n![files](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u8h9v2s54lgcz16g33cu.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's go through some of the files.\r\n\r\n**1. .vscode/launch.json**\r\n\r\nYou won't use the file but is good to know what it is for.\r\n\r\n> The launch.json file is used to configure the debugger in Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. themes/your-theme.json**\r\n\r\nThis is the file you are going to be working on to create your theme. Right now it includes the styles for VS Code default theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. .vscodeignore**\r\n\r\nBasically like .gitignore\r\n\r\n> A VSCODEIGNORE file is a text file used to exclude unnecessary files when packaging a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension.\r\n\r\n**4. Changelog.md**\r\n\r\nYou can write this changelog and if you publish it marketplace will link to it directly.\r\n\r\n**5. package.json**\r\n\r\nOn this file is where we are going to pack, add and write some code to be able to publish it on the marketplace.\r\n\r\n**6. readme.md**\r\n\r\nThis is well, the read me. Which you are going to edit before you publish, otherwise you won't be able to do so because is detected.\r\n\r\n**7. vsc-extensions-quickstart.md**\r\n\r\nIs basically telling you what all the files are but on a short way.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building your theme\r\n\r\nSo, let's go to  \"your-theme.json\" file on the themes folder\r\n\r\n![file ](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cjf7ui3dhus62p75hxyw.png)\r\n![another file](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/acmb5eruzelih4n13sw3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will see two sets of colors:\r\n\r\nSet 1 is mostly for the UI\r\n```\r\n\"colors\": {\r\n--- scopes go here ---\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSet 2 for syntax.\r\n```\r\n\"tokenColors\": [\r\n--- scopes go here ---\r\n\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo how do you know what to style?
