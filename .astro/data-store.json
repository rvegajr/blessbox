After a while, if you have a poorly crafted theme, so your eyes are going to hurt.\r\n\r\nTaking into account that you spend a lot of hours working on VS Code, you may want to created or adapt it to your taste and personality. Believe it or not, this will make you more productive and feel comfortable when working.\r\n\r\n## Let's get our hands dirty.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can customize the theme you are actually using by opening the **User settings** on VS Code your **command palette**\r\n\r\nOnce you are there you can edit the .json by starting with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\r\n    ---- Styles go here ----\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou can see all the scopes here:\r\n- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, this is a nightmare to be honest, as you can see there's a lot of scopes and it will take you ages to do it.\r\n\r\n## Let's create our own theme from scratch\r\n\r\nWe are going to need:\r\n\r\n- A laptop\r\n- VS Code installed\r\n- Microsoft Azure Account\r\n- Microsoft Marketplace Account\r\n- GitHub Account\r\n- Patience\r\n\r\nWe are going to use:\r\n- VS Code\r\n- Terminal\r\n- VS Code Debugger\r\n- A random but useful color tool\r\n\r\nFor color palettes you can use my tool [Colors & Fonts](https://www.colorsandfonts.com/)\r\n\r\nor for something more advance, use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## First and foremost\r\n\r\nLet's grab the command line tool called [Yo Code extension generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code), which it will create all the files you need to build your theme.\r\n\r\nOnly build, not publish but more on this later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Open up your terminal window and navigate to your main GitHub folder.\r\n2. Then run on the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g yo generator-code\r\n```\r\nAfter the it finishes to install run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyo code\r\n```\r\nYou will get all this options.\r\n\r\n**Select:**\r\n1. **New Color Theme**\r\n\r\nWhat type of extension do you want to create? (Use arrow keys)\r\n  New Extension (TypeScript)\r\n  New Extension (JavaScript)\r\n**❯ New Color Theme**\r\n  New Language Support\r\n  New Code Snippets\r\n  New Keymap\r\n  New Extension Pack\r\n  New Language Pack (Localization)\r\n  New Web Extension (TypeScript)\r\n  New Notebook Renderer\r\n\r\n\r\n**Select**:\r\n2. **No, start fresh**\r\n\r\nDo you want to import or convert an existing TextMate color theme? (Use arrow keys)\r\n**No, start fresh **\r\nYes, import an existing theme but keep it as tmTheme file.\r\nYes, import an existing theme and inline it in the Visual Studio Code color theme file.\r\n\r\nThen you will be asked this questions.If you are going to create this theme to be publish and grow it into a UI Theme a  part of for VS Code, you may want to think about how you name it.\r\n\r\n## Important step\r\n\r\n> Let's say you name it \"A\" this name you can change it afterwards, as the rest of answers you give but, if you change the identifier and you publish again, this will create a different theme on VS Code Marketplace\r\n\r\n3.Answer\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the name of your extension? Your Theme's name\r\n**_? What's the identifier of your extension? Your Theme's identifier_**\r\n? What's the description of your extension? Your Theme's Description\r\n? What's the name of your theme shown to the user? Your Theme's name\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we are going to need a starting point and Yo Code gives you the choices so choose the one you want to.\r\n\r\nSelect a base theme: (Use arrow keys)\r\n❯ Dark\r\n  Light\r\n  High Contrast\r\n\r\n4. Answer\r\n\r\n**Initialize a git repository? (Y/n)**\r\n\r\nI say always no because is not always working...so I simply push afterwards.\r\n\r\n5. Open do it as you wish.\r\n\r\nDo you want to open the new folder with Visual Studio Code? (Use arrow keys)\r\n❯ Open with `code`\r\n  Skip\r\n\r\n\r\n## Files\r\n\r\nThis are the files generated by Yo Code\r\n\r\n![files](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u8h9v2s54lgcz16g33cu.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's go through some of the files.\r\n\r\n**1. .vscode/launch.json**\r\n\r\nYou won't use the file but is good to know what it is for.\r\n\r\n> The launch.json file is used to configure the debugger in Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. themes/your-theme.json**\r\n\r\nThis is the file you are going to be working on to create your theme. Right now it includes the styles for VS Code default theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. .vscodeignore**\r\n\r\nBasically like .gitignore\r\n\r\n> A VSCODEIGNORE file is a text file used to exclude unnecessary files when packaging a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension.\r\n\r\n**4. Changelog.md**\r\n\r\nYou can write this changelog and if you publish it marketplace will link to it directly.\r\n\r\n**5. package.json**\r\n\r\nOn this file is where we are going to pack, add and write some code to be able to publish it on the marketplace.\r\n\r\n**6. readme.md**\r\n\r\nThis is well, the read me. Which you are going to edit before you publish, otherwise you won't be able to do so because is detected.\r\n\r\n**7. vsc-extensions-quickstart.md**\r\n\r\nIs basically telling you what all the files are but on a short way.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building your theme\r\n\r\nSo, let's go to  \"your-theme.json\" file on the themes folder\r\n\r\n![file ](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cjf7ui3dhus62p75hxyw.png)\r\n![another file](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/acmb5eruzelih4n13sw3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will see two sets of colors:\r\n\r\nSet 1 is mostly for the UI\r\n```\r\n\"colors\": {\r\n--- scopes go here ---\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSet 2 for syntax.\r\n```\r\n\"tokenColors\": [\r\n--- scopes go here ---\r\n\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo how do you know what to style? Well in this case we can press F5 or simply navigate on VS Code to the menu and click on RUN/Start Debugging.\r\n\r\nWhen you do this it will open another VS Code window showing you the theme colors on the json file. Now you will have two VS Code windows open.\r\n\r\nIn my case the left is my VS Code and right is the theme I am debugging.\r\n\r\n![Imageeee](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qv1qx60znnpehyhilsl0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you have the window open search for \"Inspect editor tokens and scopes\"\r\n\r\n![Ima](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1r5zq2o2i6fiv3jm066n.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you activate it you can click on the editors scopes and it will popup a window with all the information about it.\r\n\r\n![another image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zwxu6878w9jh4gj7ites.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information you want to get from here is the textmate scopes you can see that there is a hex color applied, look for it and change the color.\r\n\r\n![lskjn](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6vnk2p6rs97dx5jdciyw.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Publish your theme\r\n\r\nTo publish your theme we will need to do some boring work but is less cumbersome to be able to share your theme.\r\n\r\n- Sign up to [Microsoft Azure DEVOPS](https://dev.azure.com/)\r\n- Create an organization\r\n- Publish it\r\n\r\n\r\n**Signing up and creating an organization**\r\n\r\n- Sign up\r\n\r\n- Once in\r\n> Click on the icon next to your avatar and select **_personal access tokens_**\r\n\r\n- New Token\r\n> Name it\r\n\r\n\r\n- Organizations\r\n> All accessible organizations\r\n![Image ökjb](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k7b7qw61u0dc9gd1m0kt.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Click on \"Show all scopes\", right at the bottom** and look for **_Marketplace_** and check:\r\n- Manage\r\n- Click to generate the access token\r\n\r\n_**Copy the token and save somewhere you think is save.**_\r\n\r\n![Image .kjbl hkb ](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/21t6ov68gwb18iiji0dt.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Inside the marketplace**\r\n\r\n- Navigate to the [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) and log in.\r\n\r\nThere should be a \"Create publisher\" page.\r\n![Image ubyffkf](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n8kw4e44gzd2ix4vgj3z.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFill up all the fields.\r\n\r\nAfter that you will be redirected to this page.
